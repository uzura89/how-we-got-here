# How We Got Here

## AI-Generated World History

"How We Got Here" is an experimental world history timeline using AI-generated illustrations. This project explores new ways to present historical events through artificial intelligence. While we aim for an interesting overview of human civilization, it's important to note that this is primarily an experiment and should be complemented with established historical sources for a more comprehensive understanding.
