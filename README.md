# How We Got Here

## AI-Generated Human History

"How We Got Here" is an open-source project that presents the entire human history through AI-generated events, descriptions, and images. Our goal is to create an accessible, comprehensive, and continually improving historical timeline.

## Project Overview

This project uses multiple AI models to generate historical content, which is then compared with Wikipedia pages. We aim for transparency in our methods and welcome community contributions to improve accuracy and coverage.

## Key Features

- AI-generated historical events, descriptions, and images
- Reviewing of the content compared with Wikipedia
- Transparent methodology and AI prompts
- Community-driven improvements through user feedback

## How It Works

1. AI models generate initial content
2. Content is cross-referenced with Wikipedia pages
3. Community feedback is incorporated through a structured process

For detailed information on our methodology, AI prompts, and reviewing process, please see the documentation in the `docs` folder.
