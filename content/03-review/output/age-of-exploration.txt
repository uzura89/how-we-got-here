Age of Exploration: 1501 AD ~ 1600 AD

Claude: The information provided is generally correct, but the timeframe given at the end (1501 AD ~ 1600 AD) is too narrow. The Age of Exploration actually began in the early 15th century and continued into the early 17th century. A more accurate timeframe would be approximately 1400 AD to 1620 AD.
