Beginning of the Iron Age: 2000 BC ~ 1201 BC

Claude: The information provided is generally accurate, but the timeframe given is incorrect. The Iron Age began later than the stated period. 

The correct timeframe for the beginning of the Iron Age varies by region, but it is generally considered to have started around 1200 BC in the Near East, around 1100 BC in Greece, and later in other parts of Europe and Asia. The period of 2000 BC - 1201 BC would more accurately describe the latter part of the Bronze Age.
