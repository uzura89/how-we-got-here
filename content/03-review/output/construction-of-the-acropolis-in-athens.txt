Construction of the Acropolis in Athens: 800 BC ~ 701 BC

Claude: The information about the Acropolis and its construction is generally correct, but the timeframe provided (800 BC ~ 701 BC) is incorrect. The major construction of the Acropolis, including the Parthenon, took place in the 5th century BC, specifically around 447 BC as stated in the description. The correct timeframe for this event would be 500 BC ~ 400 BC.
Gemini: False. The Acropolis construction began around 447 BC and was completed in 432 BC, not 800 BC ~ 701 BC.
