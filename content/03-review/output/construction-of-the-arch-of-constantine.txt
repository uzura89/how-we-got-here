Construction of the Arch of Constantine: 201 AD ~ 300 AD

Claude: The information provided is mostly correct, but the timeframe is incorrect. 

The Arch of Constantine was indeed erected in Rome to commemorate Constantine I's victory at the Battle of Milvian Bridge. However, this event occurred in 312 AD, and the arch was completed in 315 AD. These dates fall outside the given timeframe of 201-300 AD.

The correct timeframe for this event would be 301-400 AD.
