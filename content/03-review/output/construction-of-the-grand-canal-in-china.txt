Construction of the Grand Canal in China: 501 AD ~ 600 AD

Claude: The information provided is mostly correct, but there's one small error:

The Grand Canal was not completed during the timeframe mentioned (501 AD ~ 600 AD). While construction began during the Sui Dynasty (581-618 AD), it was not completed until 609 AD, which falls just outside the given timeframe.

The correct timeframe for the completion of the Grand Canal would be 601 AD ~ 700 AD.
