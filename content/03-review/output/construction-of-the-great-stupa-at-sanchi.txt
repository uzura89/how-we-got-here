Construction of the Great Stupa at Sanchi: 301 AD ~ 400 AD

Claude: The information about the Great Stupa at Sanchi is mostly correct, but the timeframe is incorrect. 

The Great Stupa at Sanchi was originally commissioned in the 3rd century BCE by Emperor Ashoka (c. 268-232 BCE), not in 301-400 AD. The initial construction began during Ashoka's reign, and the stupa underwent several expansions and enhancements over the following centuries, particularly during the Shunga period (2nd-1st century BCE) and the Satavahana period (1st century BCE to 2nd century CE).

The correct timeframe for the initial construction would be around 250 BCE, with major enhancements occurring up to the 1st century CE.
Gemini: False. The correct timeframe for the construction of the Great Stupa at Sanchi is 3rd century BCE - 1st century BCE, during the reign of Emperor Ashoka and subsequent rulers.
