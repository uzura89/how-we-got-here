Construction of the Great Wall of China: 400 BC ~ 301 BC

Claude: The information provided is generally accurate, but the timeframe given (400 BC ~ 301 BC) is incorrect. The construction of the Great Wall as we know it today began during the Qin Dynasty, which ruled from 221 BC to 206 BC. Earlier fortifications existed, but the unified wall system started under Emperor Qin Shi Huang.
