Construction of the Hagia Sophia: 401 AD ~ 500 AD

Claude: The information provided is mostly correct, but there is one error:

The timeframe given (401 AD ~ 500 AD) is incorrect. The Hagia Sophia was completed in 537 AD, which falls outside this range. The correct timeframe for this event would be 501 AD ~ 600 AD.
