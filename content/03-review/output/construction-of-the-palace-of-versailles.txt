Construction of the Palace of Versailles: 1701 AD ~ 1800 AD

Claude: The information provided is mostly correct, but the timeframe given (1701 AD ~ 1800 AD) is inaccurate. The construction and major expansions of the Palace of Versailles primarily took place during the reign of Louis XIV, which was from 1661 to 1715. The most significant work on the palace occurred between 1661 and 1715, falling mostly within the 17th century rather than the 18th century as suggested by the given timeframe.
