Construction of the Terracotta Army: 200 BC ~ 101 BC

Claude: The information provided is mostly correct, but the timeframe given is incorrect. The Terracotta Army was constructed during the reign of Qin Shi Huang, which was from 246 BC to 210 BC. The construction of the Terracotta Army is believed to have begun around 246 BC and was completed in 208 BC. Therefore, the correct timeframe for this event would be approximately 246 BC to 208 BC, which is earlier than the range provided in the question.
