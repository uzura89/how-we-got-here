Construction of the Pont du Gard: 100 BC ~ 1 BC

Claude: The information provided is mostly correct, but there is one error regarding the timeframe:

The Pont du Gard was actually built in the 1st century AD (around 40-60 AD), not in the 1st century BC as suggested by the given timeframe of 100 BC ~ 1 BC.

The correct timeframe for this event would be 1 AD ~ 100 AD.
