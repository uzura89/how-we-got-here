Creation of the Code of Ur-Nammu: 3000 BC ~ 2001 BC

Claude: The information provided is generally correct, but there's a minor issue with the timeframe. The Code of Ur-Nammu is typically dated to around 2100-2050 BC, which falls just outside the given range of 3000 BC ~ 2001 BC. The correct timeframe should be extended to include 2000 BC, making it 3000 BC ~ 2000 BC.
