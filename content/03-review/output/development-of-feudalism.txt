Development of Feudalism: 401 AD ~ 500 AD

Claude: The development of feudalism as described is generally accurate, but the timeframe of 401-500 AD is too early. Feudalism began to develop in Europe during the 8th and 9th centuries, becoming more widespread after the fall of the Carolingian Empire in the late 9th century. It reached its peak in most of Europe during the High Middle Ages (11th-13th centuries).
