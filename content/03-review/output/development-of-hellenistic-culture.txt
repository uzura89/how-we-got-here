Development of Hellenistic Culture: 400 BC ~ 301 BC

Claude: The information provided about the Hellenistic Culture is generally correct, but the timeframe given is inaccurate. The Hellenistic period is typically dated from 323 BC (the death of Alexander the Great) to 31 BC (the conquest of the last Hellenistic kingdom by Rome). The correct timeframe should be 323 BC - 31 BC.
