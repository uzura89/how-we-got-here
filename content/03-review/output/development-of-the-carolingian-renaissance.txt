Development of the Carolingian Renaissance: 701 AD ~ 800 AD

Claude: The information provided about the Carolingian Renaissance is generally correct, but the timeframe given is not accurate. The Carolingian Renaissance is typically dated from the late 8th century to the 9th century, approximately 780-900 AD. Charlemagne became King of the Franks in 768 AD and was crowned Emperor in 800 AD, so the revival began during his reign and continued under his successors.
