Development of the Enlightenment: 1601 AD ~ 1700 AD

Claude: The information provided is mostly correct, but there is one inaccuracy regarding the timeframe:

The Enlightenment began in the late 17th century (around 1685) but primarily developed and flourished during the 18th century, extending beyond the given timeframe of 1601-1700 AD. The movement's peak and most significant impacts occurred in the 1700s.
