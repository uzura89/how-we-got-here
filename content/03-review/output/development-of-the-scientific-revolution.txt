Development of the Scientific Revolution: 1501 AD ~ 1600 AD

Claude: The information provided about the Scientific Revolution is generally correct, but the timeframe given is not entirely accurate. The Scientific Revolution is typically considered to have occurred between the mid-16th century and the late 17th or early 18th century. A more accurate timeframe would be approximately 1543 AD (publication of Copernicus' "On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres") to 1687 AD (publication of Newton's "Principia Mathematica"), extending beyond 1600 AD.
