Division of the Roman Empire: 201 AD ~ 300 AD

Claude: The division of the Roman Empire into Western and Eastern halves did occur, but not within the timeframe of 201-300 AD. The formal division of the empire took place in 395 AD when Emperor Theodosius I died and left the empire to his two sons: Arcadius in the East and Honorius in the West. This event falls outside the given timeframe and should be placed in the late 4th century AD.
