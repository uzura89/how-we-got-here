Establishment of the Gupta Empire: 201 AD ~ 300 AD

Claude: The information provided is mostly correct, but there are two inaccuracies:

1. The Gupta Empire was not founded by Sri Gupta, but by his grandson Chandragupta I around 320 AD.

2. The timeframe given (201 AD ~ 300 AD) is incorrect. The Gupta Empire was established in the early 4th century AD, with its beginning typically dated to around 320 AD.

The correct timeframe for the establishment of the Gupta Empire would be 320 AD ~ 330 AD.
