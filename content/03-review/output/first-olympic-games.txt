First Olympic Games: 1100 BC ~ 1001 BC

Claude: The information about the first Olympic Games is correct, except for the timeframe. The first recorded Olympic Games in 776 BC do not fall within the range of 1100 BC to 1001 BC. The correct timeframe for the first recorded Olympic Games would be 800 BC to 700 BC.
