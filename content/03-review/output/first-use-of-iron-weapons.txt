First Use of Iron Weapons: 700 BC ~ 601 BC

Claude: The information provided is generally correct, but the timeframe given (700 BC ~ 601 BC) is too late for the first use of iron weapons and the beginning of the Iron Age. The Iron Age and the use of iron weapons began much earlier, typically dated to around 1200 BC in the Near East, spreading to other regions over the following centuries. The period mentioned (700-601 BC) would be well into the Iron Age for many civilizations.
