Introduction of Coinage: 800 BC ~ 701 BC

Claude: The information provided is mostly correct, but the timeframe given at the end (800 BC ~ 701 BC) is incorrect. The introduction of coinage in Lydia occurred around 600 BC, which falls outside the stated timeframe. The correct timeframe for this event would be approximately 650 BC ~ 550 BC.
