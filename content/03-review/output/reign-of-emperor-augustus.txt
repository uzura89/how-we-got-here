Reign of Emperor Augustus: 1 AD ~ 100 AD

Claude: The information provided is mostly correct, but there is one minor error:

The timeframe given (1 AD ~ 100 AD) does not fully encompass Augustus' reign. Augustus became the first Roman emperor in 27 BC, which is before the start of the given timeframe. His reign began in 27 BC and ended with his death in AD 14, so it partially overlaps with the given timeframe but also extends before it.

The correct timeframe for Augustus' reign would be 27 BC - AD 14.
