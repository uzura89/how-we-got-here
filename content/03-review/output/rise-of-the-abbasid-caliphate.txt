Rise of the Abbasid Caliphate: 801 AD ~ 900 AD

Claude: The information provided is mostly correct, but the timeframe given is inaccurate. The Abbasid Caliphate rose to power in 750 AD, not within the 801-900 AD range. The Abbasid Caliphate's rule began earlier and lasted much longer, from 750 AD to 1258 AD. The 9th century (801-900 AD) was indeed part of the Islamic Golden Age under Abbasid rule, but it wasn't the beginning of their reign.
