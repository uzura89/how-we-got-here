Rise of the Khmer Empire: 1001 AD ~ 1100 AD

Claude: The information provided is mostly correct, but there is one error:

The founding date of the Khmer Empire (802 AD) falls outside the specified timeframe of 1001 AD ~ 1100 AD. The Khmer Empire was founded in the 9th century, not the 11th century.

The rest of the information about the empire's prominence, architectural achievements, and water management systems is accurate.
