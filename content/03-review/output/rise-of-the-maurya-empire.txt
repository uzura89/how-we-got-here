Rise of the Maurya Empire: 500 BC ~ 401 BC

Claude: The information about the Maurya Empire and its founder Chandragupta Maurya is correct, but the timeframe is incorrect. The Maurya Empire was established around 322 BC, which falls outside the given timeframe of 500 BC ~ 401 BC. The correct timeframe for the rise of the Maurya Empire would be 323 BC ~ 185 BC.
