Rise of the Mongol Empire: 1101 AD ~ 1200 AD

Claude: The information about the Mongol Empire is generally correct, but the timeframe provided (1101 AD ~ 1200 AD) is incorrect. The rise of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan began in the early 13th century, not the 12th century. The correct timeframe for the founding and initial expansion of the Mongol Empire would be approximately 1206 AD (when Genghis Khan was proclaimed ruler of all Mongols) to 1227 AD (the year of Genghis Khan's death).
