Rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire: 1200 BC ~ 1101 BC

Claude: The information provided about the Neo-Assyrian Empire is generally accurate, but the timeframe given (1200 BC ~ 1101 BC) is incorrect. 

The Neo-Assyrian Empire actually emerged and flourished much later, from around 911 BC to 609 BC. The period mentioned in the query (1200 BC ~ 1101 BC) more closely aligns with the Middle Assyrian period, which preceded the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

The correct timeframe for the rise and dominance of the Neo-Assyrian Empire would be approximately 911 BC to 612 BC.
