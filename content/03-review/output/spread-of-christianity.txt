Spread of Christianity: 200 BC ~ 101 BC

Claude: The information provided about the spread of Christianity is generally accurate, but the timeframe given (200 BC ~ 101 BC) is incorrect. Christianity began to spread in the 1st century AD, not BC. The correct timeframe for the initial spread of Christianity would be approximately 30 AD to 100 AD and beyond.
Gemini: Incorrect. Christianity began to spread throughout the Roman Empire during the 1st century AD, after the death of Jesus of Nazareth. It gradually grew from a small Jewish sect into a major world religion despite periods of persecution..
