Spread of Islam: 501 AD ~ 600 AD

Claude: The information about the spread of Islam is accurate, but the timeframe given (501 AD ~ 600 AD) is incorrect. The correct timeframe for this event would be 601 AD ~ 750 AD, as the spread of Islam began after Muhammad's death in 632 AD and continued throughout the 7th and early 8th centuries.
