Spread of the Black Death: 1101 AD ~ 1200 AD

Claude: The information about the Black Death itself is correct, but the timeframe provided (1101 AD ~ 1200 AD) is incorrect. 

The Black Death primarily occurred in the mid-14th century, specifically from 1347 to 1351 AD. This places it outside the given timeframe by about 150-200 years.

The correct timeframe for the main outbreak of the Black Death in Europe would be 1347 AD ~ 1351 AD.
