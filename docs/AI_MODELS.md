# AI Models Used in "How We Got Here"

This document outlines the AI models used in our project to generate and refine historical content and images. We utilize multiple models to ensure diverse perspectives and to leverage the strengths of each model.

## Text Generation Models

For generating historical events, descriptions, and comparisons, we use three leading language models:

### 1. Claude 3.5 Sonnet

- Developer: Anthropic
- Type: Large Language Model

### 2. GPT-4

- Developer: OpenAI
- Type: Large Language Model

### 3. Gemini

- Developer: Google
- Type: Large Language Model

## Image Generation Model

For creating visual representations of historical events, we use:

### DALL-E 3

- Developer: OpenAI
- Type: Text-to-Image Generation Model

## Usage in Our Project

- Event Overview Generation: GPT-4
- Detailed Information: GPT-4
- Review Process: ClaudeAI and Gemini
- Image Creation: DALL-E 3

We continuously evaluate the performance of these models and may update or add new models as AI technology advances. Our goal is to leverage the strengths of each model to create a comprehensive and accurate historical timeline.
