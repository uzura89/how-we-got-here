# AI Models Used in "How We Got Here"

This document outlines the AI models used in our project to generate and refine historical content and images. We utilize multiple models to ensure diverse perspectives and to leverage the strengths of each model.

## Text Generation Models

For generating historical events, descriptions, and comparisons, we use three leading language models:

### 1. Claude 3.5 Sonnet

- Developer: Anthropic
- Type: Large Language Model
- Key Features:
  - Strong analytical capabilities
  - Designed for detailed and thoughtful responses
  - Good at comparing and synthesizing information

### 2. GPT-4

- Developer: OpenAI
- Type: Large Language Model
- Key Features:
  - Advanced language understanding and generation
  - Broad knowledge base covering various historical periods
  - Ability to provide detailed and nuanced responses

### 3. Gemini

- Developer: Google
- Type: Large Language Model
- Key Features:
  - Multimodal capabilities (though we primarily use it for text)
  - Up-to-date knowledge base
  - Efficient at summarizing and extracting key information

## Image Generation Model

For creating visual representations of historical events, we use:

### DALL-E 3

- Developer: OpenAI
- Type: Text-to-Image Generation Model
- Key Features:
  - High-quality image generation based on textual descriptions
  - Ability to incorporate historical details and styles
  - Wide range of artistic capabilities

## Usage in Our Project

- Event Overview Generation: Claude 3.5 Sonnet,GPT-4, and Gemini are used to generate initial event overviews. Their outputs are then compared and synthesized using Claude 3.5 Sonet.
- Detailed Information: Claude 3.5 Sonnet are used to add detailed information to events.
- Review Process: GPT-4 are used to analyze and compare AI-generated content with Wikipedia information.
- Image Creation: DALL-E 3 is used exclusively for generating visual representations of historical events.

We continuously evaluate the performance of these models and may update or add new models as AI technology advances. Our goal is to leverage the strengths of each model to create a comprehensive and accurate historical timeline.
