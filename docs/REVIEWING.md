# Reviewing Process for "How We Got Here"

This document outlines the reviewing process we use to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the AI-generated historical content in our project. Our goal is to create a balance between leveraging AI capabilities and maintaining historical accuracy.

## Overview of the Review Process

1. AI Content Generation
2. Wikipedia Comparison
3. Community Feedback
4. Continuous Improvement

## Detailed Steps

### 1. AI Content Generation

- Multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini) generate initial content for historical events.
- The outputs from different models are compared and synthesized to create a comprehensive event description.

### 2. Wikipedia Comparison

- For each historical event, we use AI to compare our generated content with the corresponding Wikipedia page.
- The comparison process includes:
  - Identifying discrepancies between our content and Wikipedia
  - Suggesting corrections or additions to improve accuracy and completeness
  - Manual modification based on the suggestions

### 3. Community Feedback

- Users can report inaccuracies or suggest improvements by opening issues on our GitHub repository.
- Community members can submit pull requests with proposed changes to the content.
- All community contributions are reviewed by project maintainers and, if necessary, cross-checked with additional sources.

### 4. Continuous Improvement

- Regular reviews of AI-generated content are conducted, incorporating new information and correcting any identified inaccuracies.
- AI prompts and methodologies are refined based on the results of the review process and community feedback.
- New AI models may be incorporated as technology advances to improve the quality and accuracy of the generated content.

## Limitations and Disclaimer

While we strive for accuracy, it's important to note:

- Our primary comparison source is Wikipedia, which itself may contain inaccuracies or biases.
- AI models, despite their capabilities, can make mistakes or have biases in their training data.
- Historical interpretations can vary, and our content may not represent all perspectives on historical events.

We encourage users to approach the information critically and to consult multiple sources for important historical facts.

## How You Can Help

We welcome community involvement in our review process:

1. Report inaccuracies by opening an issue on our GitHub repository.
2. Suggest improvements or additional information through pull requests.
3. Participate in discussions about historical accuracy and interpretation.
